# Website Redesign Plan: Ascent Physiotherapy

## **Project Overview**

**Business Name**: Ascent Physiotherapy  
**Website Link**: [https://ascentphysiotherapy.com](https://ascentphysiotherapy.com)

**Description**:  
Ascent Physiotherapy is a health and wellness clinic specializing in physiotherapy, injury prevention, and rehabilitation center located in Comox Valley. They aim to provide personalized care to help clients recover and maintain optimal physical health.

The current website has very outdated look, lacks engaging content organization, and has almost no mobile optimization. This redesign will modernize the site, improve usability, and better cater to the needs of both existing and potential clients.
